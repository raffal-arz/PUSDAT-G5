# school-management-system(SMS)
Many School Mangers and Principal have been lacking the opportunity to manage their administrative activities using technological advancements such as Mobile Phones, Tablets, Computers and Internet. Currently it is difficult for School Mangers and Principals to know in real time how many students are attending classes, the Parentsâ€™ contact details of each student, or generating reports on school fee payments for each student.
